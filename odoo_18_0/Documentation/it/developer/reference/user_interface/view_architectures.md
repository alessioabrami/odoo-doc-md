# View architectures¶

## Generic architecture¶

The architecture of a view is defined by XML data interpreted by the JavaScript framework.

For most views, there is a `*.rng` file defining the attributes and possible architectures. Some views are not ruled by such a file either because they accept HTML content, or for performance reasons.

Nota

The current context and user access rights may impact the view abilities.

## Python expression¶

When evaluating node attributes, e.g. the `readonly` modifier, it is possible to provide a **Python expression** that will be executed in an environment that has access to the following variables:

  * The names of all fields present in the current view, containing the value of the current record, except for `column_invisible` in list view; relational fields are given as a list of IDs;

  * The ID of the current record;

  * `parent`: the record that refers to the container; only inside sub-views of [relational fields](../../../applications/studio/fields.html#studio-fields-relational-fields);

  * `context (dict)`: the current view’s context;

  * `uid (int)`: the id of the current user;

  * `today (str)`: the current local date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format;

  * `now (str)`: the current local datetime in the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` format.




Example
    
    
    <field name="field_a" readonly="True"/>
    <field name="field_b" invisible="context.get('show_me') and field_a == 4"/>
    

Example
    
    
    <field name="field_a"/>
    <field name="x2m">
        <!-- sub-view -->
        <form>
            <field name="field_b" invisible="parent.field_a"/>
        </form>
    </field>
    

## Form¶

Form views are used to display the data from a single record. They are composed of regular [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) with additional semantic and structural components.

The root element of form views is `form`.
    
    
    <form>
        ...
    </form>
    

### Root attributes¶

Optional attributes can be added to the root element `form` to customize the view.

string
    

The view title. It is displayed only if you open an action that has no name and whose target is `new` (opening a dialog).

### Semantic components¶

Semantic components tie into the Odoo system and allow interaction with it.

Form views accept the following children semantic components: field, label, button, Chatter widget, and Attachments preview widget.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### `field`: display field values¶

The `field` element renders (and allows editing of, possibly) a single field of the current record.

Using the same field multiple times in a form view is supported, and the fields can receive different values for the `invisible` and `readonly` attributes. These fields may have the same values but can be displayed differently. However, the behavior is not guaranteed when several fields exist with different values for the `required` attribute.
    
    
    <form>
        <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
    </form>
    

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the field to render.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

widget
    

The widget used to represent the field. The selected widget can change the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the `fields` registry.

`''`

options
    

The configuration options for the field’s widget (including default widgets), as a Python expression that evaluates to a dict.

For relation fields, the following options are available: `no_create`, `no_quick_create`, `no_open`, and `no_create_edit`.

    <field name="tag_ids" widget="many2many_tags" options="{'color_field': 'FIELD_NAME', 'no_quick_create': True}"/>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`{}`

readonly
    

Whether the field can be modified by the user (`False`) or is read-only (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>

class
    

The [HTML class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute) to set on the generated element.

The styling uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and [UI icons](icons.html#reference-user-interface-ui-icons). Common Odoo classes include:

  * `oe_inline`: prevents the usual line break following fields, and limits their span;

  * `oe_left`, `oe_right`: [floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) the element to the corresponding direction;

  * `oe_read_only`, `oe_edit_only`: only displays the element in the corresponding form mode;

  * `oe_avatar`: for image fields, displays images as an «avatar» (max 90x90 square);

  * `oe_stat_button`: defines a particular rendering to dynamically display information while being clickable to target an action.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname" class="oe_inline oe_left oe_avatar"/>
    

Example
    
    
    <button type="object" name="ACTION" class="oe_stat_button" icon="FONT_AWESOME" help="HELP">
       <div class="o_field_widget o_stat_info">

Nota

[Relational fields](../../../applications/studio/fields.html#studio-fields-relational-fields) nodes can contain specific subviews.

Example
    
    
    <field name="children_ids">
       <list>
          <field name="name"/>
       </list>
       <form>
          <field name="id"/>
          <field name="name"/>
       </form>
    </field>
    

#### `label`: display field labels¶

When a field component is not placed directly inside a group, or when its `nolabel` attribute is set, the field’s label is not automatically displayed alongside its value. The `label` component is the manual alternative of displaying the label of a field.
    
    
    <form>
        <div class="col col-md-auto">
            <label for="FIELD_NAME" string="LABEL"/>
            <div>
                <field name="FIELD_NAME" class="oe_inline"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>
    

The `label` element can have the following attributes:

for
    

The reference to the field associated with the label. It can be either the name of the field, or its id (the `id` attribute set on the field).

When there are several occurrences of the same field in the view, and there are several `label` components associated with these field nodes, these labels must have unique `for` attribute; in this case, referencing the `id` attribute of the corresponding field nodes.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

  * `oe_inline`: prevents the usual line break following fields, and limits their span;

  * `oe_left`, `oe_right`: [floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) the element to the corresponding direction;

  * `oe_read_only`, `oe_edit_only`: only displays the element in the corresponding form mode;

  * `oe_avatar`: for image fields, displays images as an «avatar» (max 90x90 square);

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>

#### Chatter widget¶

The [chatter widget](../backend/mixins.html#reference-mixins-mail-chatter) is the communication and log tool allowing to email colleagues and customers directly from a record (task, order, invoice, event, note…).

It is added with a `div` element with the class `oe_chatter` when the model inherits the `mail.thread` mixin.

Example
    
    
    <form>
        <sheet>
            ...
        </sheet>
        <div class="oe_chatter">
            <field name="message_follower_ids"/>
            <field name="activity_ids"/>
            <field name="message_ids" options="OPTIONS"/>
        </div>
    </form>
    

#### Attachments preview widget¶

The attachment preview widget is added with an _empty_ `div` element with the class `o_attachment_preview`.

Example
    
    
    <form>
        <sheet>
            ...
        </sheet>
        <div class="o_attachment_preview"/>
    <form>
    

### Structural components¶

Structural components provide structure or «visual» features with little logic. They are used as elements or sets of elements in form views.

Form views accept the following children structural components: group, sheet, notebook, notebook, newline, separator, header, footer, Buttons container, and Title container.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### `group`: define columns layouts¶

The `group` element is used to define column layouts in forms. By default, groups define 2 columns, and most direct children of groups take a single column.

field elements that are direct children of groups display a `label` by default, and the label and the field itself have a `colspan` of `1` each.

Children are laid out horizontally (they try to fill the next column before changing row).
    
    
     <form>
         <group>
             ...
         </group>
    </form>
    

The `group` element can have the following attributes:

string
    

The title displayed for the group.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`1`

invisible
    

Whether the element is visible (`False`) or hidden (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

Nota

There are two uses for the `invisible` attribute:

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>
        <field name="fname_d"/>
    <group>

        <group colspan="4">
            <field name="i"/>
        </group>
    </group>
      
  
#### `sheet`: make the layout responsive¶

The `sheet` element can be used as a direct child of the form root element for a narrower and more responsive form layout (centered page, margin…). It usually contains group elements.
    
    
    <form>
        <sheet>
            ...
        </sheet>
    </form>
    

#### `notebook` & `page`: add tabbed sections¶

The `notebook` element defines a tabbed section. Each tab is defined through a `page` child element.

The `notebook` element should not be placed within `group` elements.
    
    
    <form>
        <notebook>
            <page string="LABEL">
                ...
            </page>
        </notebook>
    </form>
    

The `page` element can have the following attributes:

string
    

The title of the tab.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

`str`

Default
    

`''`

invisible

Nota

There are two uses for the `invisible` attribute:

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>

            <page string="Page2">
                ...
            </page>
        </notebook>
    </form>
      
  
#### `newline`: start new group rows¶

The `newline` element is used within group elements to end the current row early and immediately switch to a new row, without filling any remaining column beforehand.
    
    
    <form>
        <group>
            ...
            <newline/>
            ...
        </group>
    </form>

            <newline/>
            <group string="Title 1.2">...</group>
            <group string="Title 1.3">...</group>
        </group>
    </form>
      
  
#### `separator`: add horizontal spacing¶

The `separator` element adds vertical spacing between elements within a group.
    
    
    <form>
        ...
        <separator/>
        ...
    </form>
    

The `<separator>` element can have the following attributes:

            <FIELD/>
            <separator string="Title 1"/>
            <FIELD/>
            <group>
                <FIELD/>
                <separator string="Title 2"/>
                <FIELD/>
            </group>
            <group>
                <FIELD/>
                <FIELD/>
            </group>
        </group>
    </form>
      
  
Suggerimento

The `separator` element can be used to achieve visual separation between elements within the same inner `group` element while keeping them horizontally aligned.

#### `header`: display workflow buttons and a status¶

The `header` element combined with the sheet element provides a full-width location above the sheet itself generally used to display workflow button elements and a field element rendered as status widget.
    
    
    <form>
        <header>
            <BUTTONS/>
        </header>
        <sheet>
            ...
        </sheet>
    </form>
    

Example
    
    
    <header>
        <button string="Reset" type="object" name="set_draft" invisible="state != 'done'"/>
        <field name="state" widget="statusbar" statusbar_visible="draft,posted" options="{'clickable': 1}"/>
    </header>
    

#### `footer`: display dialog buttons¶

The `footer` element is used to display buttons elements at the end of dialogs.
    
    
    <form>
        <sheet>
            ...
        </sheet>
        <footer>
            <BUTTONS/>
        </footer>
    </form>
    

Example
    
    
    <footer>
        <button string="Save" special="save"/>
        <button string="Feature action" type="object" name="my_action" class="btn-primary"/>
        <button string="Discard" special="cancel"/>
    </footer>
    

When no `footer` element is specified, the view’s standard buttons (like Save or Discard) will be present by default. It is also possible to avoid replacing the standard buttons in form or x2many dialogs by using the `replace` attribute. This attribute defaults to `True` if not specified but setting it to `False` (or 0) will make it so that the specified `footer` will be added next to the default buttons instead of replacing them.

Example
    
    
    <footer replace="0">
        <button string="Custom added action" type="object" name="my_action" class="btn-primary"/>
    </footer>
    

#### Buttons container¶

A button elements container can be created with a `div` element with the class `button_box`.
    
    
    <form>
        <div name="button_box">
            <BUTTONS/>
        </div>
    <form>
    

Possible structure and representation of its rendering  
  
---  
      
    
    <form>
        <div name="button_box">
            <button type="edit" name="edit" icon="fa-edit" string="Button1"/>
            <button type="object" name="my_action" icon="fa-dollar">
                <field name="total_inv" widget="statinfo" string="Invoices"/>
            </button>
        </div>
    <form>
      
  
#### Title container¶

A title field element container can be created with a `div` element with the class `oe_title`.
    
    
    <form>
        <sheet>
            <div class="oe_title">
                <h1><FIELD/></h1>
            </div>
        </sheet>
    <form>
    

## Settings¶

Settings views are a customization of the form view. They are used to display settings in a centralized place. They differ from generic form views in that they have a search bar and a sidebar.

Example
    
    
    <app string="CRM" name="crm">
        <setting type="header" string="Foo">
            <field name="foo" title="Foo?."/>
            <button name="nameAction" type="object" string="Button"/>
        </setting>
        <block title="Title of group Bar">
            <setting help="this is bar" documentation="/applications/technical/web/settings/this_is_a_test.html">
                <field name="bar"/>
            </setting>
            <setting string="This is Big BAR" company_specific="1">
                <field name="bar"/>
            </setting>
        </block>
        <block title="Title of group Foo">
            <setting string="Personalize setting" help="this is full personalize setting">
                <div>This is a different setting</div>
            </setting>
        </block>
    </app>
    

### Components¶

Settings views accept the field, label and button elements of form views, as well as three additional children elements: app, block, and setting.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### `app`: declare the application¶

The `app` element is used to declare the application on the settings view. It creates an entry with the logo of the application on the sidebar of the view. It also acts as delimiter when searching.
    
    
    <form>
        <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
        ...
        </app>
    </form>

`''`

invisible
    

Whether the element is visible (`False`) or hidden (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

Nota

There are two uses for the `invisible` attribute:

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>
        <field name="fname_d"/>
    <group>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

#### `block`: declare a group of settings¶

The `block` element is used to declare a group of settings. This group can have a title and a description.
    
    
     <form>
         <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
             ...
             <block title="TITLE">
                 ...
             </block>
             ...
         </app>
    </form>
    

The `block` element can have the following attributes:

title
    

The title of the block of settings. One can search on its value.

Requirement

    <group>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

#### `setting`: declare the setting¶

The `setting` element is used to declare the setting itself.

The first field element in the setting is used as the main field. It is placed on the left panel if it is a boolean field, and on the top of the right panel otherwise. The field is also used to create the setting label if a `string` attribute is not defined.

The `setting` element can also contain additional elements (e.g., HTML). All of those elements are rendered in the right panel.
    
    
    <form>
        <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
            <block title="TITLE">
                ...
                <setting string="SETTING_NAME">
                    ...
                    <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
                    ...
                </setting>
                ...
            </block>
        </app>
    </form>
    

The `<setting>` element can have the following attributes:

type
    

By default, a setting is visually separated on two panels (left and right), and is used to edit a given field. By defining `type="header"`, a special kind of setting is rendered instead. This setting is used to modify the scope of the other settings. For example, on the Website application, this setting is used to indicate to which website the other settings apply. The header setting is visually represented as a banner on top of the screen.

The path can be both an absolute or a [relative path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). In the latter case, it is relative to `https://www.odoo.com/Documentation/<version>`.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type

### Components¶

List views accept the following children elements: field, button, groupby, header, control, and create.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### `field`: display field values¶

The `field` element renders (and allows editing of, possibly) a single field of all current records as a column.

Using the same field multiple times in a list view is not supported
    
    
    <list>
        <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
    </list>
    

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the field to render.

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

widget
    

The widget used to represent the field. The selected widget can change the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the `fields` registry.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

The `string` attribute of the model’s field

optional
    

Make the visibility of the field optional. The field’s column can be hidden or shown through a button on the view’s header.

It can have two different values:

show
    

The field is shown by default.

hide
    

The field is hidden by default.

Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_a" optional="show"/>
    <field name="fname_b" optional="hide"/>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

readonly

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

invisible
    

Whether the element is visible (`False`) or hidden (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

Nota

There are two uses for the `invisible` attribute:

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>
        <field name="fname_d"/>
    <group>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

column_invisible
    

Whether the column is visible (`False`) or hidden (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

Unlike `invisible`, it affects the entire column, and is evaluated without the subtree values.

Example
    
    
    <field name="product_is_late" column_invisible="parent.has_late_products == False"/>
    <button type="object" name="action_confirm" column_invisible="context.get('hide_confirm')"/>

Requirement
    

Optional

Type

Default
    

`''`

decoration-<style>
    

The style that should be applied to matching records” field, as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

`<style>` must be replaced by one of `bf` (bold), `it` (italic), `info`, `warning`, `danger`, `muted`, `primary`, and `success`.

Example
    
    
    <field name="name" decoration-bf="1"/>
    <field name="quantity" decoration-info="state == 'draft'"/>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

sum, avg
    

The aggregate to display at the bottom of the column. The aggregation is computed on only records that are currently displayed. The aggregation operation must match the corresponding field’s `aggregator`.

Example
    
    
    <field name="sent" sum="Total" />
    <field name="clicks_ratio" avg="Average"/>

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

width
    

The list view always tries to optimize the available space among columns. For some field types, this is done by enforcing a width, depending on the field type. For instance, we know exactly the number of pixels required to display a date, so we can ensure that a column for a date field doesn’t take more space than what is strictly necessary, thus leaving the extra space for the other columns. However, the framework can’t guess the adequate width for every field types. For instance, char fields can be used to encode large values, or 3-letter country codes. In the latter case, one can set the width directly in the arch (e.g. `width="40px"`). It represents the width (always in pixels) required to render the values inside the cells. The width of the column will then be the sum of the given value and the cells” left and right paddings.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

nolabel
    

Whether the field’s column header should remain empty. If set, the column will not be sortable.

It accepts only the value `'1'`

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

Nota

When a list view is grouped, numeric fields are aggregated and displayed for each group. Also, if there are too many records in a group, a pager appears on the right of the group row. For this reason, it is a bad practice to have a numeric field in the last column when the list view is in a situation where it can be grouped. However, it does not pose a problem for X2many fields in a form view, as they cannot be grouped.

#### `groupby`: define group headers¶

The `groupby` element is used to define group headers with button elements when grouping records on [`Many2one`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2one "odoo.fields.Many2one") fields. It also accepts field elements, which can be used for modifiers. These fields thus belong on the Many2one co-model. These extra fields are fetched in batch.
    
    
    <list>
        ...
        <groupby name="FIELD_NAME">
            <BUTTONS/>
            <FIELDS/>
        </groupby>
    </list>
    

The `groupby` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the a [`Many2one`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2one "odoo.fields.Many2one") field to use as header.

A special button element with `type="edit"` can be defined to open the Many2one field’s form view.

            <button type="object" name="my_method" string="Button1" invisible="email == 'jhon@conor.com'"/>
        </groupby>
    </list>
      
  
Nota

Fields inside the `groupby` element are used only to fetch and store the value, but they are never displayed.

#### `header`: display workflow buttons¶
    
    
    <list>
        <header>
            <BUTTONS/>
        </header>
        ...
    </list>
    

The `header` element accepts the following children elements:

button
    

The `button` element allows defining buttons in the control panel. It is the same element as the button element in list views, but it accepts one more attribute when placed inside a `header` element:

display
    

Make the button available at all time, without having to select records.

It accepts only the value `always`.

Example
    
    
    <header>
        <button name="toDoAlways" type="object" string="Always displayed" display="always"/>
        <button name="toDoSelection" type="object" string="Displayed if selection"/>

        <field name="tax_id"/>
    </list>
      
  
#### `control` & `create`: add inline create buttons¶

The `control` element defines a control row that accepts create buttons. Each create button is defined through a `create` element.
    
    
    <list>
       <control>
           <create string="LABEL"/>
           <BUTTONS/>
        </control>
        ...
    </list>
    

The `control` element takes no attributes.

The `create` element can have the following attributes:

string
    

The button’s text.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

context
    

The context that is merged into the view’s context when performing the button’s call, as a Python expression that evaluates to a dict.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`{}`

Possible structure and representation of its rendering  
  
---  
      
    
    <list>
        <field name="name"/>
        <field name="amount"/>
        <field name="currency"/>
        <field name="tax_id"/>
        <control>
            <create string="Add a item"/>
            <create string="Add a section" context="{'default_type': 'section'}"/>
            <create string="Add a note" context="{'default_type': 'note'}"/>
        </control>
    </list>
      
  
Nota

Using the `control` element makes sense only if the list view is inside a [`One2many`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.One2many "odoo.fields.One2many") or [`Many2many`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2many "odoo.fields.Many2many") field. If any `create` element is defined, it overwrites the default add a line button.

## Search¶

Search views are different from other view types in that they are not used to display content. Although they apply to a specific model, they are used to filter another view’s content (usually aggregated views; e.g., List and Graph).

The root element of search views is `search`.

It takes no attributes.

Possible structure and representation of its rendering  
  
---  
      
    
    <search>
        ...
    </search>
      
  
### Components¶

Search views accept the following children elements: field, filter, separator, group, and searchpanel.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

#### `field`: filter based on field values¶

The `field` element defines domains or contexts with user-provided values. When search domains are generated, field domains are joined with each other and with filters using the **AND** operator.
    
    
    <search>
        <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
    </search>
    

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the field to filter on.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

string
    

The label of the field.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

The `string` attribute of the model’s field

operator
    

By default, fields generate domains of the form `[(name, _operator_ , value)]`, where `name` is the field’s name and `value` is the value provided by the user, possibly filtered or transformed (e.g., a user is expected to provide the _label_ of a selection field’s value, not the value itself).

The `operator` attribute allows overriding the default operator, which depends on the field’s type (e.g., `=` for float fields, but `ilike` for char fields and `child_of` for many2one).

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`=`

filter_domain
    

The domain to use as the field’s search domain, as a Python expression that evaluates to a [domain](../backend/orm.html#reference-orm-domains).

It can use the `self` variable to inject the provided value in the custom domain. It can be used to generate significantly more flexible domains than with the `operator` attribute alone (e.g., search on multiple fields at once).

If both the `operator` and `filter_domain` attributes are provided, `filter_domain` takes precedence.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`[]`

context
    

The context to merge into the context of the view that the search view is targeting, as a Python expression that evaluates to a dict.

It can contain user-provided values, which are available under the `self` variable.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`{}`

domain
    

The filters to apply to the completion results for fields that allow for auto-completion (e.g., [`Many2one`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2one "odoo.fields.Many2one")).

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`[]`

groups
    

The comma-separated list of user groups to whom the element is displayed. Users who do not belong to at least one of these groups are unable to see the element. Groups can be prefixed with the negative `!` operator to exclude them.

Example
    
    
    <field name="FIELD_NAME" groups="base.group_no_one,!base.group_multi_company"/>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

invisible
    

Whether the element is visible (`False`) or hidden (`True`), as a Python expression that evaluates to a bool.

Nota

There are two uses for the `invisible` attribute:

  * Usability: to avoid overloading the view and to make it easier for the user to read, depending on the content.

  * Technical: a field must be present (invisible is enough) in the view to be used in a Python expression.




Example
    
    
    <field name="fname_b" invisible="fname_c != 3 and fname_a == parent.fname_d"/>
    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>
        <field name="fname_d"/>
    <group>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

Possible structure and representation of its rendering  
  
---  
      
    
    <search>
        <field name="name" string="My Custom Name"/>
        <field name="amount"/>
        <field name="currency_id"/>
        <field name="ref" filter_domain="[('name', 'like', self)]"/>
    </search>
      
  
#### `filter`: create pre-defined filters¶

The `filter` element is used to create pre-defined filters that can be toggled in the search view. It allows adding data to the search context the context passed to the data view for searching/filtering, or appending new sections to the search filter.
    
    
    <search>
        <filter string="LABEL" domain="DOMAIN"/>
    </search>
    

The `filter` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The technical name of the filter. It can be used to enable it by default or as an [inheritance hook](view_records.html#reference-view-records-inheritance).

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

string
    

The label of the filter.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

domain
    

The domain to append to the action’s domain as part of the search domain.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`[]`

date
    

The name of the `date` or `datetime` field to filter on.

When used, this attribute creates a set of filters available in a sub-menu of the Filters menu. The available filters are time-dependent but not dynamic in the sense that their domains are evaluated at the time of the control panel instantiation.

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date"/>
    

By default, these filters contain a dropdown with different sub-filters that allow you to filter based on months, quarters and years. Additionally, you can create custom sub-filters that allow filtering using domains. These custom filters must have the following attributes: `name`, `string` and `domain`.

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date">
       <filter name="create_date_last_30_days" string="Last 30 Days" domain="[('create_date', '&gt;', datetime.datetime.combine(context_today() - relativedelta(days=30), datetime.time(23, 59, 59)).to_utc())]"/>
    </filter>
    

Note that all custom filters defined this way are mutually exclusive with each other and with the other sub-filters.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

start_month
    

The earliest month that will show up in the dropdown of a date filter, as an offset relative to the current month.

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date" start_month="-3"/>
    

If the current month is February, the earliest month selectable in the dropdown will be November.

default_period
    

The default period of the time-based filter (with a `date` attribute). It must be one of, or a comma-separated list of valid filter ids.

Valid filter ids include the following:

  * `first_quarter`, `second_quarter`, `third_quarter` and `fourth_quarter`.

  * One of `month`, `month-x` and `month+x`, where `x` is a non-zero integer value between `start_month` and `end_month`.

  * One of `year`, `year-x` and `year+x`, where `x` is a non-zero integer value between `start_year` and `end_year`.

  * The `name` of any custom filter defined within the filter, prepended with `custom_`.




The filter must be in the default set of filters activated at the view initialization.

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date" default_period="year,month-1"/>
    

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date" default_period="custom_create_date_last_30_days">
       <filter name="create_date_last_30_days" string="Last 30 Days" domain="[('create_date', '&gt;', datetime.datetime.combine(context_today() - relativedelta(days=30), datetime.time(23, 59, 59)).to_utc())]"/>
    </filter>

    <group invisible="fname_c != 4">
        <field name="fname_c"/>
        <field name="fname_d"/>
    <group>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`False`

groups
    

The comma-separated list of user groups to whom the element is displayed. Users who do not belong to at least one of these groups are unable to see the element. Groups can be prefixed with the negative `!` operator to exclude them.

Example
    
    
    <field name="FIELD_NAME" groups="base.group_no_one,!base.group_multi_company"/>
    

Requirement

Default
    

`''`

context
    

The context merged into the action’s domain to generate the search domain

The context key `group_by` set with a field as value can be used to define a group available in the Group By menu. When the field is of type `date` or `datetime`, the filter generates a submenu of the Group By menu with the following interval options available: Year, Quarter, Month, Week, and Day. When the filter is in the default set of filters activated at the view initialization, the records are grouped by month by default. This can be changed by using the syntax `date_field:interval`.

Example
    
    
    <filter string="Category" name="groupby_category" context="{'group_by': 'category_id'}"/>
    <filter string="Creation Date" name="groupby_create_date" context="{'group_by': 'create_date:week'}"/>
    

Nota

The results of `read_groups` grouped on a field may be influenced by its `group_expand` attribute, allowing to display empty groups when needed. For more information, please refer to [`Field`](../backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Field "odoo.fields.Field").

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

Python expression

Default
    

`{}`

Attenzione

Sequences of filters (without non-filters elements separating them) are treated as inclusively composited: they will be composed with `OR` rather than the usual `AND`.

Example
    
    
    <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'draft')]"/>
    <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'done')]"/>
    

Records whose `state` field is `draft` or `done` are shown.

Example
    
    
    <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'draft')]"/>
    <separator/>
    <filter domain="[('delay', '&lt;', 15)]"/>
    

Records whose `state` field is `draft` **and** `delay` field is below 15.

Possible structure and representation of its rendering

        <filter string="My orders" domain="[('user_id', '=', uid)]"/>
        <filter string="Category" context="{'group_by': 'category_id'}"/>
    </search>
      
  
#### `separator`: separate groups of filters¶

The `separator` element is used to separates groups of filters in simple search views. For more complex search views, the group element is recommended.
    
    
    <search>
        <FILTERS/>
        <separator/>
        <FILTERS/>
    </search>
    

The `separator` element takes no attributes.

#### `group`: separate groups of filters¶

The `group` element is used to separate groups of filters in cluttered search views. In simpler search views, it can be substituted for the separator element.
    
    
    <search>
        <group>
            <FILTERS/>
        </group>
    </search>
    

The `group` element takes no attributes.

#### `searchpanel`: display search panels¶

The `searchpanel` element displays a search panel to the left of multi-records views. It allows for quickly filtering data on the basis of given fields.
    
    
    <search>
        <searchpanel>
            <FIELDS/>
        </searchpanel>
    </search>
    

The `searchpanel` element accepts only `field` children elements.

The `field` element used as a child element of a `searchpanel` element can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the field to filter on.

Requirement

At most one value can be selected. Supported field types are `many2one` and `selection`.

multi
    

Several values can be selected. Supported field types are `many2one`, `many2many` and `selection`.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`one`

groups
    

The comma-separated list of user groups to whom the element is displayed. Users who do not belong to at least one of these groups are unable to see the element. Groups can be prefixed with the negative `!` operator to exclude them.

Example
    
    
    <field name="FIELD_NAME" groups="base.group_no_one,!base.group_multi_company"/>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

When the `field` element has the `select=multi` attribute set, it can have the following additional attributes:

enable_counters
    

Whether the record counters is computed and displayed if non-zero.

Suggerimento

This attribute exists to avoid impacting performance. Another way to address performance issues is to override the `search_panel_select_range` and `search_panel_select_multi_range` methods.

### Search defaults¶

Search fields and filters can be configured through the action’s `context` using `search_default__name_` keys. For fields, the value must be the value to set to the field. For filters, it must be a boolean value or a number.

Example

With `foo`, a field, and `bar`, a filter, the following action context will search `foo` on `acro` and enable `bar` by default:
    
    
    {
        'search_default_foo': 'acro',
        'search_default_bar': 1
    }
    

A numeric value (between 1 and 99) can be used to define the order of default _groupby_ filters.

Example

With `foo` and `bar`, two _groupby_ filters, the following action context will first enable `bar`, then `foo`.
    
    
    {
        'search_default_foo': 2,
        'search_default_bar': 1
    }
    

## Kanban¶

Kanban views are used as a [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) visualisation: they display records as «cards», halfway between a list and a form view.

Records may be grouped in columns for use in workflow visualisation or manipulation (e.g., tasks or work-progress management), or ungrouped (used simply to visualize records).

The root element of Kanban views is `kanban`.

Possible structure and representation of its rendering  
  
---  
      
    
    <kanban>
        ...
    </kanban>
      
  
Nota

Kanban views load and display a maximum of ten columns. Any column after that is closed but can still be opened by the user.

### Root attributes¶

Optional attributes can be added to the root element `kanban` to customize the view.

### Components¶

Kanban views accept the following children elements: templates, field, header, progressbar.

#### `templates`: define cards structure¶

The `templates` element is used to define the [QWeb templates](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb) that structure the kanban cards.

The definition of a card’s structure can be split into multiple templates for clarity, but at least one root `card` template must be defined.

An additional template can be defined: `menu`. If defined, it is rendered inside a dropdown that can be toggled with a vertical ellipsis (⋮) on the top right of the card.

The templates are written in [JavaScript QWeb](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb-javascript).
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field name="name"/>
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

Avvertimento

These are QWeb templates, not [Owl](https://github.com/odoo/owl) templates, meaning that directives like `t-on-click` aren’t available.

##### Fields¶

Inside those templates, the `field` element allows to render a field. It can have the following attributes:

name
    

The name of the field to render.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

widget
    

The widget used to represent the field. The selected widget can change the way the field is rendered and/or the way it can be edited. It refers to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the `fields` registry.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

By default, field nodes are replaced by a `span` containing their formatted value, unless the `widget` attribute is specified, in which case their rendering and behavior depends on the corresponding widget. The `widget` attribute can have different values including:

> handle
>     
> 
> Allows reordering records with a drag and drop, using the corresponding field as order.
> 
> kanban_color_picker
>     
> 
> Allows editing a color (integer) field. Combined with the root attribute `highlight_color`, allows editing the color of the cards.

See the [Field section](../frontend/javascript_reference.html#reference-js-widgets) to discover various widgets and their options.

##### Rendering Context¶

Kanban templates being rendered with the [QWeb engine](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb-javascript), they have a _rendering context_ , a set of variables available in the templates, containing useful information and tools. Here’re the available variables:

record
    

An object with all the fields defined in the view. Each field has two attributes: `value` and `raw_value`. The former is formatted according to current user parameters, while the latter is the raw value (e.g. the `id` for a many2one field). This object is useful for instance, for using field values inside `t-if` conditions. For display purposes, we recommend using the `<field>` tag.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <field name="is_company"/>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field name="name"/>
             <field t-if="!record.is_company.raw_value" name="parent_id">
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

widget
    

An object with 2 keys defining the available actions for the user:

  * `editable`: true if the user can edit records, false otherwise;

  * `deletable`: true if the user can delete records, false otherwise.




This is useful to conditionally display elements requiring specific access rights.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field name="name"/>
          </t>
          <t t-name="menu">
             <a t-if="widget.deletable" role="menuitem" type="delete" class="dropdown-item">Delete</a>
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

context
    

The current context propagated from either the action that opens the kanban view, or the one2many or many2many field that embeds the kanban view in a form view.

read_only_mode
    

Indicates that the view is readonly.

Type
    

[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "\(in Python v3.13\)")

selection_mode
    

Whether the kanban view is opened when selecting a many2one or many2many field (in mobile environment).

Type
    

[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "\(in Python v3.13\)")

luxon
    

The [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html) object, allowing to manipulate date and datetime field values.

JSON
    

The Javascript [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) namespace object containing a `parse` method allowing to parse json field values into Javascript Objects.

##### Buttons and links¶

While most of the kanban templates are standard [QWeb templates](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb), the kanban view processes `button` and `a` elements is a special way. Buttons and links with a `type` attribute perform different operations than their standard HTML function. The `type` attribute can have the values `action` and `object` of regular buttons, or the following values:

> open
>     
> 
> Clicking the element opens the card’s record in form view.
> 
> delete
>     
> 
> Clicking the element deletes the card’s record and removes the card.
> 
> archive
>     
> 
> Clicking the element archives the card’s record and removes the card.
> 
> unarchive
>     
> 
> Clicking the element unarchives the card’s record and removes the card.
> 
> set_cover
>     
> 
> Clicking the element allows to select an image to set as cover image of the record.

##### Widgets¶

The `widget` element allows to insert dynamically generated (in Javascript) html inside the cards. It has a mandatory `name` attribute, referring to a Javascript implementation (an Owl component) registered to the `view_widgets` registry.

See the [Widget section](../frontend/javascript_reference.html#reference-javascript-reference-view-widgets) to discover various widgets and their options.

##### Layouts¶

Several card layouts can be easily obtained using standard html elements and [Bootstrap utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/api/). By default, the card is a [flexbox container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) with `column` direction.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field class="fw-bold fs-5" name="display_name"/>
             <field class="text-muted" name="parent_id"/>
             <field name="tag_ids" widget="many2many_tags"/>
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

The `footer` html element is styled to stick to the bottom of the card, and is as a flexbox container with `row` direction, allowing to easily display several fields on the same line.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field class="fw-bold fs-5" name="display_name"/>
             <field class="text-muted" name="parent_id"/>
             <field name="tag_ids" widget="many2many_tags"/>
             <footer>
                <field name="priority" widget="priority"/> <!-- bottom left corner -->
                <field class="ms-auto" name="activity_ids" widget="kanban_activity"/> <!-- bottom right corner -->
             </footer>
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

To display some content, like an image, on the side of the card, one can use `aside` and `main` html elements, with the `flex-row` classname on the card. The `main` node is a flexbox container like the card is when there’s no `aside`.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <t t-name="card" class="flex-row">
             <aside>
                <field name="avatar_128" widget="image" alt="Avatar"/>
             </aside>
             <main class="ms-2">
                <field class="fw-bold fs-5" name="display_name"/>
                <field class="text-muted" name="parent_id"/>
                <field name="tag_ids" widget="many2many_tags"/>
                <footer>
                   <field name="priority" widget="priority"/>
                   <field class="ms-auto" name="activity_ids" widget="kanban_activity"/>
                </footer>
             </main>
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

Suggerimento

The classname `o_kanban_aside_full` set on the `aside` element removes the padding so that the image spreads to the borders of the card.

#### `field`: declare more fields to fetch¶

The `field` element can also be used _outside_ the kanban templates. In that case, it allows to declare fields that are not displayed in the card, but still need to be fetched, for instance because their value is used in a `t-if` condition.

Example
    
    
    <kanban>
       <templates>
          <field name="is_company"/>
          <t t-name="card">
             <field name="name"/>
             <field t-if="!record.is_company.raw_value" name="parent_id">
          </t>
       </templates>
    </kanban>
    

#### `header`: display buttons in the control panel¶

The `header` element is used to insert custom buttons in the control panel.
    
    
    <kanban>
       <header>
          ...
       </header>
       ...
    </kanban>
    

The `header` element accepts only `button` children elements, similar to list views” button elements.

The `button` element used as a child element of the `header` element can have the following additional attributes:

display
    

The display mode of the button. It can have two different values:

display
    

The button is displayed only when some records are selected; their action applies to the selected records.

always
    

The button is displayed at all times, even if no records are selected.

Importante

Only the `always` display mode is available because it is not yet possible to select records in a kanban view.

Example
    
    
    <header>
        <button name="toDoAlways" type="object" string="Always displayed" display="always"/>
        <button name="toDoSelection" type="object" string="Displayed if selection"/>
    </header>
    

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`display`

#### `progressbar`: show progress bars on top of columns¶

The `progressbar` element is used to define a progress bar to display on top of kanban columns in grouped kanban views.
    
    
    <kanban>
        <progressbar field="FIELD_NAME"/>
        ...
    </kanban>
    

The `progressbar` element can have the following attributes:

field
    

The name of the field on which the progress bar’s sub-groups are based.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

The mapping of the progress bar’s field values to the color values `muted`, `success`, `warning`, and `danger`.

Requirement
    

Mandatory

Type
    

[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)

sum_field
    

The name of the field to use in a sum displayed next to the progress bar. If not set, the total number of records is displayed instead.

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`''`

---  
      
    
    <kanban>
        <progressbar field="activity_state"
                     colors="{'planned': 'success', 'today': 'warning', 'overdue': 'danger'}"
                     sum_field="expected_revenue"/>
        <templates>
            ...
        </templates>
    </kanban>
      
  
## QWeb¶

QWeb views are standard [QWeb Templates](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb) templates inside a view’s `arch`. They don’t have a specific root element. Because QWeb views don’t have a specific root element, their type must be specified explicitly (it can not be inferred from the root element of the `arch` field).

QWeb views have two use cases:

  * they can be used as frontend templates, in which case [template](../backend/data.html#reference-data-template) should be used as a shortcut.

  * they can be used as actual qweb views (opened inside an action), in which case they should be defined as regular view with an explicit `type` (it can not be inferred) and a model.




The main additions of qweb-as-view to the basic qweb-as-template are:

  * qweb-as-view has a special case for a `<nav>` element bearing the CSS class `o_qweb_cp_buttons`: its contents should be buttons and will be extracted and moved to the control panel’s button area, the `<nav>` itself will be removed, this is a work-around to control panel views not existing yet

  * qweb-as-view rendering adds several items to the standard qweb rendering context:

`model`
    

the model to which the qweb view is bound

`domain`
    

the domain provided by the search view

`context`
    

the context provided by the search view

`records`
    

a lazy proxy to `model.search(domain)`, this can be used if you just want to iterate the records and not perform more complex operations (e.g. grouping)

  * qweb-as-view also provides additional rendering hooks:

    * `_qweb_prepare_context(view_id, domain)` prepares the rendering context specific to qweb-as-view

    * `qweb_render_view(view_id, domain)` is the method called by the client and will call the context-preparation methods and ultimately `env['ir.qweb'].render()`.




## Graph¶

The graph view is used to visualize aggregations over a number of records or record groups. Its root element is `<graph>` which can take the following attributes:

`type` (optional)
    

one of `bar` (default), `pie` and `line`, the type of graph to use

`stacked` (optional)
    

only used for `bar` charts. Set to `0` to prevent the bars within a group to be stacked initially.

`disable_linking` (optional)
    

set to `1` to prevent from redirecting clicks on graph to list view

`order` (optional)
    

if set, x-axis values will be sorted by default according their measure with respect to the given order (`asc` or `desc`). Only used for `bar` and `pie` charts.

`string` (optional)
    

string displayed in the breadcrumbs when redirecting to list view.

sample
    

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For example, a field `display_name` on the model `res.users` will be populated with sample people names, while an `email` field will be in the form `firstname.lastname@sample.demo`.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column added, etc.).

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`False`

The only allowed element within a graph view is `field` which can have the following attributes:

`name` (mandatory)
    

the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather than aggregating)

`invisible` (optional)
    

if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor in the selectable measures.

`type` (optional)
    

if set to `measure`, the field will be used as an aggregated value within a group instead of a grouping criteria. It only works for the last field with that attribute but it is useful for other fields with string attribute (see below).

`interval` (optional)
    

on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval (`day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter` or `year`) instead of grouping on the specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or date (fixed day resolution). Default is `month`.

`string` (optional)
    

only used for field with `type="measure"`. The name that will be used to display the field in the graph view, overrides the default python String attribute of the field.

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically sorted on the string of the field.

Avvertimento

graph view aggregations are performed on database content, non-stored function fields can not be used in graph views

In Graph views, a `field` can have a `widget` attribute to dictate its format. The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most interesting are `float_time`, and `monetary`.
    
    
    <field name="working_hours_close" widget="float_time"/>
    

## Pivot¶

The pivot view is used to visualize aggregations as a [pivot table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table). Its root element is `<pivot>` which can take the following attributes:

`disable_linking` (optional)
    

Set to `1` to remove table cell’s links to list view.

`display_quantity` (optional)
    

Set to `1` to display the Quantity column by default.

`default_order` (optional)
    

The name of the measure and the order (asc or desc) to use as default order in the view.
    
    
    <pivot default_order="foo asc">
       <field name="foo" type="measure"/>
    </pivot>
    

The only allowed element within a pivot view is `field` which can have the following attributes:

`name` (mandatory)
    

the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather than aggregating)

`string` (optional)
    

the name that will be used to display the field in the pivot view, overrides the default python String attribute of the field.

`type` (optional)
    

indicates whether the field should be used as a grouping criteria or as an aggregated value within a group. Possible values are:

`row` (default)
    

groups by the specified field, each group gets its own row.

`col`
    

creates column-wise groups

`measure`
    

field to aggregate within a group

`interval`
    

on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval (`day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter` or `year`) instead of grouping on the specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or date (fixed day resolution).

`invisible` (optional)
    

if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor in the selectable measures (useful for fields that do not make sense aggregated, such as fields in different units, e.g. € and $).

sample
    

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For example, a field `display_name` on the model `res.users` will be populated with sample people names, while an `email` field will be in the form `firstname.lastname@sample.demo`.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column added, etc.).

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`False`

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically sorted on the string of the field.

like the graph view, the pivot aggregates data on database content which means that non-stored function fields can not be used in pivot views

In Pivot view a `field` can have a `widget` attribute to dictate its format. The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most interesting are `date`, `datetime`, `float_time`, and `monetary`.

For instance a timesheet pivot view could be defined as:
    
    
    <pivot string="Timesheet">
        <field name="employee_id" type="row"/>
        <field name="date" interval="month" type="col"/>
        <field name="unit_amount" type="measure" widget="float_time"/>
    </pivot>
    

## Calendar¶

Calendar views display records as events in a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly calendar.

Nota

By default the calendar view will be centered around the current date (today). You can pass a specific initial date to the context of the action in order to set the initial focus of the calendar on the period (see `mode`) around this date (the context key to use being `initial_date`)

Their root element is `<calendar>`. Available attributes on the calendar view are:

string
    

string (default: `''`)

This view title is displayed only if you open an action that has no name and whose target is “new” (opening a dialog)

create
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record creation on the view.

edit
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record edition on the view.

delete
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

`date_start` (required)
    

name of the record’s field holding the start date for the event

`date_stop`
    

name of the record’s field holding the end date for the event, if `date_stop` is provided records become movable (via drag and drop) directly in the calendar

`date_delay`
    

alternative to `date_stop`, provides the duration of the event instead of its end date (unit: day)

`color`
    

name of a record field to use for _color segmentation_. Records in the same color segment are allocated the same highlight color in the calendar, colors are allocated semi-randomly. Displayed the display_name/avatar of the visible record in the sidebar

`form_view_id`
    

view to open when the user create or edit an event. Note that if this attribute is not set, the calendar view will fall back to the id of the form view in the current action, if any.

`event_open_popup`
    

If the option “event_open_popup” is set to true, then the calendar view will open events (or records) in a FormViewDialog. Otherwise, it will open events in a new form view (with a do_action)

`quick_create`
    

enables quick-event creation on click: only asks the user for a `name` (the field to which this values is saved can be controlled through `rec_name`) and tries to create a new event with just that and the clicked event time. Falls back to a full form dialog if the quick creation fails

`quick_create_view_id`
    

View to open when the attribute `quick_create` is set and the user creates an event instead of the default dialog.

`create_name_field`
    

name of the record’s field holding the textual representation of the record, this is used when creating records through the “quick create” mechanism

`all_day`
    

name of a boolean field on the record indicating whether the corresponding event is flagged as day-long (and duration is irrelevant)

`mode`
    

Default display mode when loading the calendar. Possible attributes are: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`

`scales`
    

Comma-separated list of scales to provide. By default, all scales are available. See mode for possible scale values.

`create`, `delete`
    

allows disabling the corresponding action in the view by setting the corresponding attribute to `false`

`<field>`
    

declares fields to aggregate or to use in kanban _logic_. If the field is simply displayed in the calendar cards.

Fields can have additional attributes:

`invisible`
    

use «True» to hide the value in the cards

`avatar_field`
    

only for x2many field, to display the avatar instead of the display_name in the cards

`write_model` and `write_field` and `filter_field`
    

you can add a filter and save the result in the defined model, the filter is added in the sidebar. The `filter_field` is optional and allows you to specify the field that will hold the status of the filter.

`filters` and `color`
    

use «True» to add this field in filter in the sidebar. You can specify a `color` field used to colorize the checkbox.

### Model Commons¶

Model._date_name _ = 'date'_
    

field to use for default calendar view

## Activity¶

The Activity view is used to display the activities linked to the records. The data are displayed in a chart with the records forming the rows and the activity types the columns. The first cell of each row displays a (customizable, see `templates`, quite similarly to Kanban) card representing the corresponding record. When clicking on others cells, a detailed description of all activities of the same type for the record is displayed.

Avvertimento

The Activity view is only available when the `mail` module is installed, and for the models that inherit from the `mail.activity.mixin`.

The root element of the Activity view is `<activity>`, it accepts the following attributes:

`string` (mandatory)
    

A title, which should describe the view

Possible children of the view element are:

`field`
    

declares fields to use in activity _logic_. If the field is simply displayed in the activity view, it does not need to be pre-declared.

Possible attributes are:

`name` (required)
    

the name of the field to fetch

`templates`
    

defines the [QWeb Templates](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb) templates. Cards definition may be split into multiple templates for clarity, but activity views _must_ define at least one root template `activity-box`, which will be rendered once for each record.

The activity view uses mostly-standard [javascript qweb](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb-javascript) and provides the following context variables (see Kanban for more details):

`widget`
    

the current `ActivityRecord()`, can be used to fetch some meta-information. These methods are also available directly in the template context and don’t need to be accessed via `widget`

`record`
    

an object with all the requested fields as its attributes. Each field has two attributes `value` and `raw_value`

## Cohort¶

Enterprise feature

The cohort view is used to display and understand the way some data changes over a period of time. For example, imagine that for a given business, clients can subscribe to some service. The cohort view can then display the total number of subscriptions each month, and study the rate at which client leave the service (churn). When clicking on a cell, the cohort view will redirect you to a new action in which you will only see the records contained in the cell’s time interval; this action contains a list view and a form view.

Nota

By default the cohort view will use the same list and form views as those defined on the action. You can pass a list view and a form view to the context of the action in order to set/override the views that will be used (the context keys to use being `form_view_id` and `list_view_id`)

For example, here is a very simple cohort view:
    
    
    <cohort string="Subscription" date_start="date_start" date_stop="date" interval="month"/>
    

The root element of the Cohort view is <cohort>, it accepts the following attributes:

`string` (mandatory)
    

A title, which should describe the view

`date_start` (mandatory)
    

A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view as the beginning date of a record

`date_stop` (mandatory)
    

A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view as the end date of a record. This is the field that will determine the churn.

`disable_linking` (optional)
    

Set to `1` to prevent from redirecting clicks on cohort cells to list view.

`mode` (optional)
    

A string to describe the mode. It should be either “churn” or “retention” (default). Churn mode will start at 0% and accumulate over time whereas retention will start at 100% and decrease over time.

`timeline` (optional)
    

A string to describe the timeline. It should be either “backward” or “forward” (default). Forward timeline will display data from date_start to date_stop, whereas backward timeline will display data from date_stop to date_start (when the date_start is in future / greater than date_stop).

`interval` (optional)
    

A string to describe a time interval. It should be “day”, “week”, “month”” (default) or “year”.

`measure` (optional)
    

A field that can be aggregated. This field will be used to compute the values for each cell. If not set, the cohort view will count the number of occurrences.

`<field>` (optional)
    

allows to specify a particular field in order to manage it from the available measures, it’s main use is for hiding a field from the selectable measures:

`name` (mandatory)
    

the name of the field to use in the view.

`string` (optional)
    

the name that would be used to display the field in the cohort view, overrides the default python String attribute of the field.

`invisible` (optional)
    

if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor in the selectable measures (useful for fields that do not make sense aggregated, such as fields in different units, e.g. € and $). If the value is a domain, the domain is evaluated in the context of the current row’s record, if `True` the corresponding attribute is set on the cell.

`widget` (optional)
    

alternate representations for a field’s display.

odoo.addons.base.models.ir_ui_view.sample
    

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For example, a field `display_name` on the model `res.users` will be populated with sample people names, while an `email` field will be in the form `firstname.lastname@sample.demo`.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column added, etc.).

Requirement
    

Optional

Type
    

[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "\(in Python v3.13\)")

Default
    

`False`

## Grid¶

Enterprise feature

### Limitations¶

This view is a work in progress and may have to be expanded or altered.

  * only `date` column fields have been tested, `selection` and `many2one` are nominally implemented and supported but have not been tested, `datetime` is not implemented at all.

  * column cells are hardly configurable and must be numerical

  * cell adjustment is disabled by default and must be configured to be enabled

  * `create`, `edit` and `delete` ACL metadata doesn’t get automatically set on the view root due to limitations in `fields_view_get` post-processing (there’s a fixed explicit list of the view types getting those attributes)




### Schema¶

The grid view has its own schema and additional validation in this module. The view architecture is:

`<grid>` (1)
    

architecture root element

  * mandatory `string` attribute

  * optional `create`, `edit` and `delete` attributes

  * optional `adjustment` and `adjust_name` attributes

`adjustment` can be either `object` or `action` to indicate whether a cell’s adjustment should be performed through a method call or an action execution. `adjust_name` provides respectively the method name and the action id.

In both cases, the adjustment parameters are provided as a `grid_adjust` context member, in the `object` case, the parameters are also provided as positional function parameters (next to an empty list of ids):

`row_domain`
    

the domain matching the entire row of the adjusted cell

`column_field`
    

the name of the column for the adjusted cell

`column_value`
    

the value of the column for the adjusted cell

`cell_field`
    

the measure field of the adjusted cell

`change`
    

the difference between the old value of the cell and the adjusted one, may be positive or negative

  * optional `hide_line_total` and `hide_column_total` attributes

`hide_line_total`
    

set to true to hide total line (default false)

`hide_column_total`
    

set to true to hide total column (default false)

  * optional `barchart_total` attribute

`barchart_total`
    

set to `true` in order to display a bar chart at the bottom of the grid, based on the totals of the columns (default false).

  * optional `create_inline` and `display_empty` attributes

`create_inline`
    

set to `true` in order to display an additional row at bottom of the grid with an `Add a line` button (default false). When this option is set to `true`, the `Add a line` button from the control panel is hidden. When no data is available and when `display_empty` is not set (so when the help content is displayed), the the `Add a line` button from the control panel is shown in order to let the user create a first record.

`display_empty`
    

set to `true` in order to keep displaying the grid when there is no data (default false). This can be useful when you want the user to be able to keep track of the current period (as dates are displayed in the columns headers). As a reminder, when no data are present and when this attribute is no set, the help content is displayed instead of the grid.



`<button>` (0+)
    

Regular Odoo action buttons, displayed in the view header

  * mandatory `string` attribute (the button label)

  * mandatory `type` attribute, either `object` or `action`

Nota

workflow buttons are not supported

  * mandatory `name` attribute, either the name of the method to call, or the ID of the action to execute

  * optional `context`




The server callback is provided with all the record ids displayed in the view, either as the ids passed to the method (`object` button) or as the context’s `active_ids` (`action` buttons)

`<field type="row">` (1+)
    

Row grouping fields, will be replaced by the search view’s groupby filter if any.

The order of `row` fields in the view provides their grouping depth: if the first field is `school` and the second is `age` the records will be grouped by `school` first and by `age` within each school.

`<field type="col">` (1)
    

Column grouping field.

The col field can contain 0+ `<range>` elements which specify customisable column ranges. `range` elements have the following mandatory attributes

`name`
    

can be used to override the default range (the first one by default) through the `grid_range` context value

`string`
    

the range button’s label (user-visible)

`span`
    

symbolic name of the span of all columns to display at once in the view, may trigger pagination.

For `date` fields, valid spans are currently `week` and `month`.

`step`
    

symbolic name of the step between one column and the previous/next

For `date` fields, the only valid span is currently `day`.

`<field type="measure">` (1)
    

Cell field, automatically accumulated (by `read_group`).

The measure field can take a `widget` attribute to customise its display.

### Server interactions¶

Aside from optional buttons, the grid view currently calls two methods:

  * `read_grid` (provided on all models by the module) returns almost the entirety of the grid’s content as a dict:

    * the row titles is a list of dictionaries with the following keys:

`values` (required)
    

this maps to a dictionary with a key per `row` field, the values are _always_ of the form `[value, label]`.

`domain` (required)
    

the domain of any record at the source of this row, in case it’s necessary to copy a record during cell adjustment

    * the column titles is a list of dictionaries with at least one key:

`values` (required)
    

see row title values

`domain` (required)
    

see column domain value

`current` (optional)
    

boolean, marks/highlights a column

    * the grid data as a list (of rows) of list (of cells) of cell dicts each with the following keys:

`value`
    

the numeric value associated with the cell

`domain`
    

the domain matching the cell’s records (should be assumed opaque)

`size`
    

the number of records grouped in the cell

`readonly` (optional)
    

a boolean indicating that this specific cell should not be client-editable

`classes` (optional)
    

a list of classes (as strings) to add on the cell’s container (between the cell’s TD and the cell’s potentially-editable element).

In case of conflicts between this list and the base classes (prefixed with `o_grid_cell_`), the classes in this list are ignored.

Note that the grid data is _dense_ , if querying the database yields no group matching a cell a cell will generate an «empty» cell with default values for required keys.

    * `prev` and `next` which can be either falsy (no pagination) or a context item to merge into the view’s own context to `read_grid` the previous or next page, it should be assumed to be opaque

  * `read_grid_domain(field, range)` (provided on al models by the module) returns the domain matching the current configured «span» of the grid. This is also done internally by `read_grid`, but can be useful or necessary to call independently to use with separate e.g. `search_count` or `read_group`.

  * `adjust_grid`, for which there currently isn’t a blanket implementation and whose semantics are likely to evolve with time and use cases




### Server Hooks¶

`read_grid` calls a number of hooks allowing the customisation of its operations from within without having to override the entire method:

`_grid_format_cell(group, cell_field)`
    

converts the output of a read_group (group-by-group) into cells in the format described above (as part of «the grid data»)

`_grid_make_empty_cell(row_domain, column_domain, view_domain)`
    

generates an empty version of a cell (if there is no corresponding group)

`_grid_column_info(name, range)`
    

generates a ColumnMetadata object based on the column type, storing values either returned directly (as part of `read_grid`) or used query and reformat `read_group` into `read_grid`:

`grouping`
    

the actual grouping field/query for the columns

`domain`
    

domain to apply to `read_group` in case the column field is paginated, can be an empty list

`prev` and `next`
    

context segments which will be sent to `read_grid` for pages before and after the current one. If `False`, disables pagination in that direction

`values`
    

column values to display on the «current page», each value is a dictionary with the following keys:

`values`
    

dictionary mapping field names to values for the entire column, usually just `name` -> a value

`domain`
    

domain matching this specific column

`is_current`
    

`True` if the current column should be specifically outlined in the grid, `False` otherwise

`format`
    

how to format the values of that column/type from `read_group` formatting to `read_grid` formatting (matching `values` in ColumnInfo)

### ACL¶

  * if the view is not editable, individual cells won’t be editable

  * if the view is not creatable, the `Add a Line` button will not be displayed (it currently creates a new empty record)




### Context Keys¶

`grid_range`
    

selects which range should be used by default if the view has multiple ranges

`grid_anchor`
    

if applicable, used as the default anchor of column ranges instead of whatever `read_grid` defines as its default.

For date fields, the reference date around which the initial span will be computed. The default date anchor is «today» (in the user’s timezone)

## Gantt¶

Enterprise feature

Gantt views appropriately display Gantt charts (for scheduling).

The root element of gantt views is `<gantt/>`, it has no children but can take the following attributes:

string
    

string (default: `''`)

This view title is displayed only if you open an action that has no name and whose target is “new” (opening a dialog)

create
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record creation on the view.

edit
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record edition on the view.

delete
    

bool (default: `True`)

Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

`date_start` (required)
    

name of the field providing the start datetime of the event for each record.

`date_stop` (required)
    

name of the field providing the end duration of the event for each record.

`dependency_field`
    

name of the `many2many` field that provides the dependency relation between two records. If B depends on A, `dependency_field` is the field that allows getting A from B. Both this field and `dependency_inverted_field` field are used to draw dependency arrows between pills and reschedule them.

`dependency_inverted_field` (required if `dependency_field` is provided)
    

name of the `many2many` field that provides the invert dependency relation than `dependency_field`. If B depends on A, `dependency_inverted_field` is the field that allows getting B from A.

`color`
    

name of the field used to color the pills according to its value

`decoration-{$name}`
    

[python expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) that evaluates to a bool

allow changing the style of a cell’s text based on the corresponding record’s attributes.

`{$name}` can be one of the following [bootstrap contextual color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#available-variations) (`danger`, `info`, `secondary`, `success` or `warning`).

Define a conditional display of a record in the style of a row’s text based on the corresponding record’s attributes.

Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is evaluated with the record’s attributes as context values and if `true`, the corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some of the other values available in the context:

  * `uid`: the id of the current user,

  * `today`: the current local date as a string of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`,

  * `now`: same as `today` with the addition of the current time. This value is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.



    
    
    <gantt decoration-info="state == 'draft'"
          decoration-danger="state == 'help_needed'"
          decoration-bf="state == 'busy'">
      ...
    </gantt>
    

`default_group_by`
    

name of a field to group tasks by

`disable_drag_drop`
    

if set to true, the gantt view will not have any drag&drop support

`consolidation`
    

field name to display consolidation value in record cell

`consolidation_max`
    

dictionary with the «group by» field as key and the maximum consolidation value that can be reached before displaying the cell in red (e.g. `{"user_id": 100}`)

`consolidation_exclude`
    

name of the field that describes if the task has to be excluded from the consolidation if set to true it displays a striped zone in the consolidation line

`create`, `cell_create`, `edit`, `delete`, `plan`
    

allows _dis_ abling the corresponding action in the view by setting the corresponding attribute to `false` (default: `true`).

  * `create`: If enabled, an `Add` button will be available in the control panel to create records.

  * `cell_create`: If enabled and `create` enabled, a «**+** » button will be displayed while hovering on a time slot cell to create a new record on that slot.

  * `edit`: If enabled, the opened records will be in edit mode (thus editable).

  * `plan`: If enabled and `edit` enabled, a «magnifying glass» button will be displayed on time slots to plan unassigned records into that time slot.




Example

When you do not want to create records on the gantt view and the beginning and end dates are required on the model, the planning feature should be disabled because no record will ever be found.

`offset`
    

Depending on the scale, the number of units to add to today to compute the default period. Examples: An offset of +1 in default_scale week will open the gantt view for next week, and an offset of -2 in default_scale month will open the gantt view of 2 months ago.

`progress`
    

name of a field providing the completion percentage for the record’s event, between 0 and 100

`string`
    

title of the gantt view

`precision`
    

JSON object specifying snapping precisions for the pills in each scale.

Possible values for scale `day` are (default: `hour`):

  * `hour`: records times snap to full hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 8:00)

  * `hour:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:30)

  * `hour:quarter`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:15)




Possible values for scale `week` are (default: `day:half`):

  * `day`: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  * `day:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)




Possible values for scale `month` are (default: `day:half`):

  * `day`: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  * `day:half`: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)




Scale `year` always snap to full day.

Example of precision attribute: `{"day": "hour:quarter", "week": "day:half", "month": "day"}`

`total_row`
    

boolean to control whether the row containing the total count of records should be displayed. (default: `false`)

`collapse_first_level`
    

boolean to control whether it is possible to collapse each row if grouped by one field. (default: `false`, the collapse starts when grouping by two fields)

`display_unavailability`
    

boolean to mark the dates returned by the `gantt_unavailability` function of the model as available inside the gantt view. Records can still be scheduled in them, but their unavailability is visually displayed. (default: `false`)

`default_scale`
    

default scale when rendering the view. Possible values are (default: `month`):

  * `day`

  * `week`

  * `month`

  * `year`



`scales`
    

comma-separated list of allowed scales for this view. By default, all scales are allowed. For possible scale values to use in this list, see `default_scale`.

`templates`
    

defines the [QWeb Templates](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb) template `gantt-popover` which is used when the user hovers over one of the records in the gantt view.

The gantt view uses mostly-standard [javascript qweb](../frontend/qweb.html#reference-qweb-javascript) and provides the following context variables:

`widget`
    

the current `GanttRow()`, can be used to fetch some meta-information. The `getColor` method to convert in a color integer is also available directly in the template context without using `widget`.

`on_create`
    

If specified when clicking the add button on the view, instead of opening a generic dialog, launch a client action. this should hold the xmlid of the action (eg: `on_create="%(my_module.my_wizard)d"`

`form_view_id`
    

view to open when the user create or edit a record. Note that if this attribute is not set, the gantt view will fall back to the id of the form view in the current action, if any.

`dynamic_range`
    

if set to true, the gantt view will start at the first record, instead of starting at the beginning of the year/month/day.

`pill_label`
    

If set to true, the time appears in the pill label when the scale is set on week or month. (e.g. `7:00 AM - 11:00 AM (4h) - DST Task 1`)

`thumbnails`
    

This allows to display a thumbnail next to groups name if the group is a relationnal field. This expects a python dict which keys are the name of the field on the active model. Values are the names of the field holding the thumbnail on the related model.

Example: tasks have a field user_id that reference res.users. The res.users model has a field image that holds the avatar, then:
    
    
    <gantt
       date_start="date_start"
       date_stop="date_stop"
       thumbnails="{'user_id': 'image_128'}"
     >
     </gantt>
    

will display the users avatars next to their names when grouped by user_id.

odoo.addons.base.models.ir_ui_view.sample
    

Whether the view should be populated with a set of sample records if none are found for the current model.

These fake records have heuristics for certain field names/models. For example, a field `display_name` on the model `res.users` will be populated with sample people names, while an `email` field will be in the form `firstname.lastname@sample.demo`.

The user is unable to interact with these data, and they will be discarded as soon as an action is performed (record created, column added, etc.).

## Map¶

Enterprise feature

This view is able to display records on a map and the routes between them. The records are represented by pins. It also allows the visualization of fields from the model in a popup tied to the record’s pin.

Nota

The model on which the view is applied should contain a `res.partner` many2one since the view relies on the `res.partner`’s address and coordinates fields to localize the records.

### API¶

The view uses location data platforms” API to fetch the tiles (the map’s background), do the geoforwarding (converting addresses to a set of coordinates) and fetch the routes. The view implements two API, OpenStreetMap and MapBox. OpenStreetMap is used by default and is able to fetch [tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_data_server) and do [geoforwarding](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/). This API does not require a token. As soon as a valid [MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/) token is provided in the general settings the view switches to the MapBox API. This API is faster and allows the computation of routes. A token can be obtained by [signing up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) to MapBox.

### Structural components¶

The view’s root element is `<map>`. It can have the following attributes:

`res_partner`
    

Contains the `res.partner` many2one. If not provided the view resorts to create an empty map.

`default_order`
    

If a field is provided the view overrides the model’s default order. The field must be part of the model on which the view is applied, not from `res.partner`.

`routing`
    

if `1` display the routes between the records. The view needs a valid MapBox token and at least two located records (i.e the records have a `res.partner` many2one and the partner has an address or valid coordinates).

`hide_name`
    

if `1` hide the name from the pin’s popup (default: `0`).

`hide_address`
    

if `1` hide the address from the pin’s popup (default: `0`).

`hide_title`
    

if `1` hide the title from the pin list (default: `0`).

`panel_title`
    

String to display as title of the pin list. If not provided, the title is the action’s name or «Items» if the view is not in an action.

`limit`
    

Maximum number of records to fetch (default: `80`). It must be a positive integer.

The `<map>` element can contain multiple `<field>` elements. Each `<field>` element is interpreted as a line in the pin’s popup. The field’s attributes are the following:

`name`
    

The field to display.

`string`
    

String to display before the field’s content. It can be used as a description.

For example here is a map:
    
    
    
    <map res_partner="partner_id" default_order="date_begin" routing="1" hide_name="1">
        <field name="partner_id" string="Customer Name"/>
    </map>
