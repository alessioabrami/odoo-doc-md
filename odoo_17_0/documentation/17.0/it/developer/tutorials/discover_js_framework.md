# Discover the web framework¶

  * [Chapter 1: Owl components](discover_js_framework/01_owl_components.html)
  * [Chapter 2: Build a dashboard](discover_js_framework/02_build_a_dashboard.html)



This two parts tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the web framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have some prior experience, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation for using the web framework in your projects.

The first part covers the basics of Owl components, which are a key part of the web framework. Owl components are reusable UI components that can be used to build complex web interfaces quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to create and use Owl components in Odoo. Then, in the second part of this tutorial, we focus on creating a dashboard using various features of Odoo. Dashboards are an essential part of any web application, and provide a nice starting point to use and interact with the Odoo codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development with Odoo in general (models, controllers, QWeb, …). If you are new to Odoo, we recommend that you start with the [Server framework 101](server_framework_101.html) tutorial before proceeding with this one.

Nota

Each chapter of this tutorial is an independant project. If you feel comfortable with Owl, you can start directly with chapter 2.

## Setup¶

  1. Clone the [official Odoo tutorials repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials) and switch to the branch `17.0`.

  2. Add the cloned repository to your [`--addons-path`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-odoo-bin-addons-path).

  3. Start a new Odoo database and install the modules `awesome_owl` (for chapter 1) and `awesome_dashboard` (for chapter 2).
