# New vehicles¬∂

Odoo‚Äôs _Fleet_ app manages all vehicles, and the accompanying documentation that comes with vehicle maintenance, and drivers records.

Upon opening the Fleet application, all vehicles are organized within the Vehicles dashboard, which is the default dashboard for the _Fleet_ application. Each vehicle is displayed in its corresponding Kanban stage, based on its status. The default stages are New Request, To Order, Registered, and Downgraded.

To add a new vehicle to the fleet from the Vehicles page, click the New button in the top-left corner, and a blank vehicle form loads. Then, proceed to enter the vehicle information on the vehicle form.

The form auto-saves as data is entered. However, the form can be saved manually at any time by clicking the _save manually_ option, represented by a (cloud upload) icon, located in the top-left corner of the page.

## Vehicle form fields¬∂

  * Model: select the vehicle‚Äôs model from the drop-down menu. Once a model is selected, additional fields may appear on the form.

If the model is not listed, type in the model name, and click either Create ¬´model¬ª, or Create and edit‚Ä¶ to [create a new model and edit the model details](models.html#fleet-add-model).

  * License Plate: enter the vehicle‚Äôs license plate number in this field.

  * Tags: select any tags from the drop-down menu, or type in a new tag. There is no limit on the amount of tags that can be selected.




Nota

The Model is the only required field on the new vehicle form. When a model is selected, other fields appear on the vehicle form, and relevant information auto-populates the fields that apply to the model. If some of the fields do not appear, this may indicate there is no model selected.

### Driver section¬∂

This section of the vehicle form relates to the person who is currently driving the car, as well as any plans for a change in the driver in the future, and when.

  * Driver: select the driver from the drop-down menu, or type in a new driver and click either Create ¬´driver¬ª or Create and edit‚Ä¶ to create a new driver, and edit the driver details.

Importante

A driver does **not** have to be an employee. When creating a new driver, the driver is added to the _Fleet_ application, **not** the _Employees_ application.

If the _Contacts_ application is installed, the driver information is also stored in the _Contacts_ application.

  * Mobility Card: if the selected driver has a mobility card listed on their employee card in the _Employees_ application, the mobility card number appears in this field. If there is no mobility card listed, and one should be added, [edit the employee record](../employees/new_employee.html#employees-hr-settings) in the _Employees_ application.

  * Future Driver: if the next driver for the vehicle is known, select the next driver from the drop-down menu. Or, type in the next driver and click either Create ¬´future driver¬ª or Create and edit‚Ä¶ to create a new future driver, and edit the driver details.

  * Plan To Change Car: if the current driver set for this vehicle plans to change their vehicle - either because they are waiting on a new vehicle that is being ordered, or this is a temporary vehicle assignment, and they know which vehicle they are driving next - check this box. Do **not** check this box if the current driver does not plan to change their vehicle.

  * Assignment Date: using the drop-down calendar, select when the vehicle is available for another driver. Select the date by navigating to the correct month and year using the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (left arrow) and ‚û°Ô∏è (right arrow) icons. Then, click on the specific day. If this field is left blank, that indicates the vehicle is currently available, and can be reassigned to another driver. If it is populated, the vehicle is not available for another driver until the selected date.

  * Company: select the company from the drop-down menu. This field only appears in a multi-company database.




#### Create a new driver¬∂

If a driver is not already in the system, the new driver should first be configured and added to the database. A new driver can be added either from the Driver or Future Driver fields on the vehicle form.

First, type in the name of the new driver in either the Driver or Future Driver field, then click Create and edit‚Ä¶. A Create Driver or Create Future Driver form appears, depending on which field initiated the form.

Both the Create Driver and Create Future Driver forms are identical.

Nota

  * Individual or Company: choose if the driver being added is an individual driver or a company. Click the radio button to make a selection.

  * Follow-up Address: select this option to add a preferred address for all follow-up correspondence. When added to the form, this address is selected by default when sending reminders about overdue invoices.

  * Other Address: select this option to add any other necessary addresses for the company or driver.




Depending on the Contact Type, some optional fields may not be visible. The available fields are identical to the fields in the general information section of the new driver form.

Add any notes to the Internal notes‚Ä¶ section of the form.

After entering all of the information, click either Save & Close to add the one new contact, or Save & New to add the current address record and create another address record.

As contacts are added to this tab, each contact appears in a separate box, with an icon indicating what type of contact is listed.
