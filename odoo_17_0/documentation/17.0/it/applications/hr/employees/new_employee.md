# Nuovi dipendenti¬∂

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee record. This record is a centralized place where all important information about the employee is stored, including general information, job history and skills, various work information, personal details, documents, and more.

To begin, open the Employees app, then click the New button in the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank employee form.

Proceed to fill out the required information, along with any additional details.

Nota

The current company phone number and name are populated in the Work Phone and Company fields. If the _Appraisals_ application is installed, the Next Appraisal Date field is populated with a date six months from the current date.

## General information¬∂

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered. However, the form can be saved manually at any time by clicking the Save manually option, represented by a (cloud with an upwards arrow) icon.

### Required fields¬∂

  * Employee‚Äôs Name: enter the employee‚Äôs name.

  * Company: from the drop-down menu in this field, select the company the new employee was hired by, or create a new company by typing the name in the field, and clicking Create or Create and edit‚Ä¶ from the mini drop-down menu that appears.




### Optional fields¬∂

  * Photo: in the top-right image box of the employee form, click on the ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil) edit icon to select a photo to upload.

  * Job Position: enter the employee‚Äôs job title under their name, or select it from the Job Position field drop-down menu below to have this top field auto-populate. The Job Position field under the employee name can be modified, and does _not_ need to match the selection made in the Job Position drop-down menu in the field below.

Example

While it is recommended to have the job positions match, the typed-in description in this top field can contain more specific information than the selected drop-down Job Position, if desired.

For instance, if someone is hired for a sales representative position configured as Sales Representative in the _Recruitment_ app, that can be selected in the drop-down Job Position field.

In the typed-in Job Position field beneath the Employee‚Äôs Name field, the position could be more specific, such as `Sales Representative - Subscriptions` if the employee is focused solely on subscription sales.

  * Tags: select a tag from the drop-down menu to add relevant tags to the employee. Any tag can be created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is available for all employee records. There is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added.

  * Work Contact Information: enter the employee‚Äôs Work Mobile, Work Phone, Work Email, and/or Company name, if not already auto-populated.

  * Department: select the employee‚Äôs department from the drop-down menu.

  * Job Position: select the employee‚Äôs job position from the drop-down menu. Once a selection is made, the Job Position field beneath the Employee‚Äôs Name field automatically updates to reflect the currently selected job position. These positions are from the [Recruitment](../recruitment/new_job.html) application, and reflect the currently configured job positions.

  * Manager: select the employee‚Äôs manager from the drop-down menu.

  * Coach: select the employee‚Äôs coach from the drop-down menu.

  * Next Appraisal Date: this field is **only** visible if the _Appraisals_ application is installed. The date automatically populates with a date that is computed according to the settings configured in the _Appraisals_ application. This date can be modified using the calendar selector.




Nota

After a Manager is selected, if the Coach field is blank, the selected manager automatically populates the Coach field.

Suggerimento

To make edits to the selected Department, Manager, Coach, or Company, click the Internal Link arrow next to the respective selection. The Internal Link arrow opens the selected form, allowing for modifications. Click Save after any edits are made.

## Additional information tabs¬∂

### Resum√© tab¬∂

#### Curriculum vitae¬∂

Next, enter the employee‚Äôs work history in the Resum√© tab. Each resum√© line must be entered individually. When creating an entry for the first time, click Create a new entry, and the Create Resum√© lines form appears. After an entry is added, the Create a new entry button is replaced with an Add button. Enter the following information for each entry.

  * Title: type in the title of the previous work experience.

  * Employee: select the employee from the drop-down menu.

  * Type: from the drop-down menu, select either Experience, Education, Side Projects, Internal Certification, Completed Internal Training, or type in a new entry, then click Create ¬´(Type)¬ª.

Proceed to use the < (left arrow) and > (right arrow) icons to scroll to the desired month, then click on the day to select it. Repeat this process to locate and select the end date. When the desired dates have been selected, click ‚úîÔ∏è Apply.

  * Description: enter any relevant details in this field.




Once all the information is entered, click the Save & Close button if there is only one entry to add, or click the Save & New button to save the current entry and create another resum√© line.

Nota

After the new employee form is saved, the current position and company is automatically added to the Resum√© tab, with the end date listed as `current`.

#### Competenze¬∂

An employee‚Äôs skills can be entered in the Resum√© tab in the same manner that a resum√© line is created.

In order to add a skill to an employee record, the skill types must be configured first. If no skill types are configured, a Create new Skills button appears in the Skills section of the Resum√© tab. Configure the skill types before adding any skills to the employee record.

If the skill types are configured, a Pick a skill from the list button appears instead. Click the Pick a skill from the list button, and select the following information for each skill.

  * Skill Type: select a skill type by clicking the radio button next to the skill type.

  * Skill: after selecting a Skill Type, the corresponding skills associated with that selected Skill Type appear in a drop-down menu. For example, selecting Language as the Skill Type presents a variety of languages to select from under the Skills field. Select the appropriate pre-configured skill, or type in a new skill, then click Create ¬´(new skill)¬ª.

  * Skill Level: pre-defined skill levels associated with the selected Skill Type appear in a drop-down menu. First, select a Skill Level, then the progress bar automatically displays the pre-defined progress for that specific skill level. Skill levels and progress can be modified in the Skill Level pop-up form, which is accessed via the Internal Link arrow next to Skill Level field.




Click the Save & Close button if there is only one skill to add, or click the Save & New button to save the current entry and immediately add another skill.

To delete any line from the Resum√© tab, click the üóëÔ∏è (trash can) icon to delete the entry. Add a new line by clicking the Add button next to the corresponding section.

Importante

Only users with Officer: Manage all employees or Administrator rights for the _Employees_ app can add or edit skills.

##### Skill types¬∂

In order to add a skill to an employee‚Äôs form, the Skill Types must be configured. Go to Employees app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Employee: Skill Types to view the currently configured skill types and create new skill types.

Nota

The default skill of Languages is pre-configured as a skill _type_ , but there are no specific language _skills_ listed within that skill type. The Languages skill type must be fully configured before it can be used.

Click New and a new Skill Type form appears. Fill out all the details for the new skill type. Repeat this for all the needed skill types.

  * Skill Type: enter the name of the skill type. This acts as the parent category for more specific skills and should be generic.

  * Skills: click Add a line, and enter the Name for the new skill, then repeat for all other needed skills.

  * Levels: click Add a line, and enter the Name of the level. Next, click into the Progress field, and enter a percentage (0-100) for that level. Repeat for all additional levels, as needed.

  * Default Level: click the toggle on the level line to set that level as the default. Typically, the lowest level is set as the default, but any level can be chosen. The toggle turns green, indicating it is the default level for the skill. Only one level can be set as the default.

Example

To add a math skill set, enter `Math` in the Name field. Next, in the Skills field, enter `Algebra`, `Calculus`, and `Trigonometry`. Last, in the Levels field enter `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, and `Expert`, with the Progress listed as `25`, `50`, and `100`, respectively. Last, click Set Default on the `Beginner` line to set this as the default skill level.




The Skill Type form automatically saves as data is entered.

Suggerimento

Once the form is completely filled out, click the Save manually button, represented by a cloud with an upwards arrow icon at the top of the screen, and the Levels rearrange in descending order, with the highest level at the top, and the lowest at the bottom, regardless of the default level and the order they were entered.

### Work information tab¬∂

Working hours can be modified in the _Payroll_ application, where they are referred to as Working Schedules.
