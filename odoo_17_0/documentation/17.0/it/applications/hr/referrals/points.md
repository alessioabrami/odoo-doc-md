# Referral points¶

The _Referrals_ application allows employees to earn points that are then exchanged for [rewards](rewards.html).

Current referral points can be viewed on the main _Referrals_ app dashboard, which appears when the application is opened, after the [onboarding](../referrals.html#referrals-onboarding) slides have been viewed or skipped.

At the top, a summary of the user’s current points is displayed. The left side of the summary displays the Total points earned, and the right side displays the points that are available To Spend.

To view the various referral stages, and their respective earned points, click one of the referral statuses beneath the avatar. The options are: Referrals, Ongoing, and Successful.

The current number of referrals that are still active in the recruitment pipeline, but have not yet been hired or refused, appear above Ongoing. The number of referrals that have been hired, appear above Successful. The total number of referrals, both the ongoing and successful referrals combined, appears above Referrals.

## My referrals¶

To see all the referrals, both ongoing and successful, click Referrals. The My Referral screen page displays all the referrals, with each individual referral housed in its own referral card.

A successful referral displays a white __ Hired badge in the top-right corner of the card, along with a vertical green stripe on the left-side of the card. Referrals that are in process have a purple In Progress badge in the top-right corner.

Each referral card lists the name of the applicant, the subject/application title as it appears on the applicant card in the _Recruitment_ app, the name of the job position, the person responsible for filling the role (i.e. the recruiter), and the points earned.

For referrals that have been hired, the selected avatar also appears on the card.

### Punti¶

The points that can be earned for a referral are the same across all job positions. Each stage of the recruitment process has corresponding points assigned to it. The stages listed correspond to the stages configured in the _Recruitment_ application.

On each individual referral card, beneath the points earned, is a progress bar that displays how many points have been earned out of the total possible points that can be earned, if the applicant is hired.

Beneath the bar chart is a list of the various recruitment stages, and the points earned when the referral moves to that stage. If a stage has been achieved, and the points have been earned, a green __(checkmark) appears next to the stage.

Nota

The preconfigured point structure for referrals is as follows:

  * Initial Qualification: 1 point

  * First Interview: 20 points

  * Second Interview: 9 points

  * Contract Proposal: 5 points

  * Contract Signed: 50 points




The default total points earned for a referral that is hired is 85 points. Modifications of the points earned for each stage are made in the _Recruitment_ application. Refer to the [Recruitment](../recruitment.html#recruitment-modify-stages) documentation to modify the points for each stage.
