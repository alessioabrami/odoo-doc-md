# Avvisi¶

In the _Referrals_ application, it is possible to post a message, also referred to as an _alert_ , at the top of the dashboard to share important information with users.

Alerts remain on the main _Referrals_ dashboard for the specified amount of time configured on the individual alert.

## Create an alert¶

Only users with _Administrator_ access rights for the _Recruitment_ application can create alerts. To add a new alert, navigate to the Referrals app ‣ Configuration ‣ Alerts.

Click New to open a blank alert form. Enter the following information on the form:

  * Date From: the date the alert starts. On this date, the alert is visible on the dashboard.

  * Date To: the date the alert ends. After this date, the alert is hidden from view.

  * Company: the current company populates this field, by default. To modify the company the alert should be displayed for, select the desired company from the drop-down menu in this field.

If this field remains blank, the alert is visible to everyone with access to the _Referrals_ application.

If a company is specified, only users within that company (who also have access to the _Referrals_ application) see the alert. This field **only** appears when in a multi-company database.

  * Alert: enter the text for the alert. This message appears inside the alert banner on the main _Referrals_ dashboard.

  * On Click: there are three options for the alert. Click the radio button next to the desired selection. The options are:

    * Not Clickable: the alert only displays text, there is no link to click.

    * Go to All Jobs: the alert contains a link that, when clicked, navigates to the website with all the job positions that are currently posted.

    * Specify URL: the alert contains a link to a specific URL that, when clicked, navigates to that URL. When selected, a URL field appears below the On Click section. Enter the desired URL in that field.




## Dismiss an alert¶

It is possible to dismiss an alert, if a user does not wish to see a specific alert again.

To dismiss an alert, click the __(remove) icon on the far-right side of the alert to remove the alert from the dashboard.

This prevents the alert from appearing again, even when opening the _Referrals_ application for the first time in a new session.
