# SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) customer payments¶

SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a payment-integration initiative of the European Union that facilitates standardized and simplified electronic payments in euros across participating countries. With **SEPA Direct Debit** (SDD), customers sign a mandate that authorizes you to collect future payments from their bank accounts. This is particularly useful for recurring payments based on a [subscription](../../../sales/subscriptions.html).

You can record customer SDD mandates in Odoo and generate XML files listing payments to be collected with the mandates. Uploading these files to your bank instructs them to collect these payments from your customers.

Nota

  * SDD is supported by all SEPA countries, which includes the 27 member states of the European Union as well as additional countries.

  * [List of all SEPA countries](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/other/epc-list-sepa-scheme-countries).




## Configurazione¶

### Creditor identifier¶

To enable SDD for customer payments, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, scroll to the Customer Payments section, enable SEPA Direct Deposit (SDD), and click Save. Then, scroll to the Customer Payments section again, set the company’s Creditor Identifier, and click Save.

Suggerimento

The creditor identifier is provided by your bank or the authority responsible for delivering them in your country. For testing purposes, you can use the test creditor identifier `DE98ZZZ09999999999`.

### PAIN file version¶

By default, the SEPA-compliant XML files generated by Odoo use the SDD **PAIN.008.001.02** format. If your bank requires the updated 2023 version, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals. Then, in the Incoming Payments tab, set the SEPA Pain version field to Updated 2023 (Pain 008.001.08).

## SEPA Direct Debit Mandates¶

An SDD mandate is a legal document authorizing a company to debit funds from a customer’s bank account. It includes key information, such as the customer’s name and IBAN, the mandate’s start and end date, and the mandate’s unique identifier. The mandate form must be filled in and signed by the customer.

### Creating mandates¶

To create an SDD mandate:

  1. Go to Accounting ‣ Customers ‣ Direct Debit Mandates.

  2. Click New and fill out the fields.

  3. Click Print to generate a PDF of the mandate form, then send it to the customer for signature.

  4. Click Validate to activate the mandate.




Importante

A valid IBAN must be defined in the Account Number field of the [bank journal](../bank.html) used to receive SDD payments for the mandate.

Suggerimento

  * To print the mandate form after the mandate has been validated, click the __( gear) icon, then select Mandate form.

  * The SDD Scheme depends on the type of customer: Select CORE for B2C customers and B2B for B2B customers.

  * SDD mandates are created automatically for [online payments made with SDD](../../payment_providers/sdd.html).




Once an SDD mandate is active, subsequent SDD payments can be generated via Odoo and uploaded to your online banking interface. Customers with an active SDD mandate can also use this payment method for [online purchases](../../payment_providers/sdd.html).

### Closing or revoking a mandate¶

SDD mandates are closed automatically after their End Date. If this field is left empty, the mandate remains active until it is closed or revoked. To close or revoke a mandate, go to Accounting ‣ Customers ‣ Direct Debit Mandates, select the relevant mandate, and click Close or Revoke.

**Closing** a mandate updates the mandate’s end day to the current day. Invoices issued after the present day will not be processed with an SDD payment. **Revoking** a mandate disables the mandate immediately. No SDD payment can be registered anymore, regardless of the invoice’s date. However, payments that have already been registered are still included in the next SDD XML file.

Avvertimento

Closed or revoked mandates cannot be reactivated.

## Processing SDD payments¶

All registered SDD payments can be processed at once by uploading an XML file containing a batch of all posted SDD payments to your online banking interface. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. [Create a batch payment](batch.html#accounting-batch-creation) and include the SDD payments to collect.

Suggerimento

You can filter payments by SDD scheme using the SDD CORE and SDD B2B filters.

  2. Validate the batch payment. The XML file is generated automatically and available for download in the chatter.

  3. Download the XML file and upload it to your online banking interface to process the payments.

  4. Once the SDD batch payment has been received, [reconcile the transaction](../bank/reconciliation.html) with the batch payment to mark the related invoices as Paid.




Suggerimento

To view the payments and invoices linked to a specific SDD mandate, click the Collections and Invoices Paid smart button on the Direct Debit Mandate form.

Nota

The files generated by Odoo follow the SEPA Direct Debit **PAIN.008.001.02** specifications, as required by the SEPA customer-to-bank [implementation guidelines](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/implementation-guidelines/sepa-credit-transfer-customer-psp-implementation), which ensures compatibility with the banks.

## SDD rejections¶

SDD rejections can occur for several reasons, the most common being insufficient funds in the customer’s account. With SDD, the recipient’s account is credited before the funds are actually debited from the customer’s account. As a result, if an SDD payment is later rejected, the bank automatically withdraws the amount of that payment from the recipient’s account, and a new transaction for a negative amount is created to reflect the SDD rejection.

In this case, you must reverse the journal entry associated with the rejected payment and reconcile the reversal of the journal entry with the transaction for the SDD rejection. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. Access the invoice linked to the rejected SDD payment.

  2. Click the __(information) icon in the footer of the Invoice Lines tab, then click View to access the payment associated with the invoice.

  3. Click the Journal entry smart button to access the related journal entry.

  4. Click Reverse entry, optionally edit the fields in the popup, then click Reverse. A reversal entry is created with a Reference mentioning the initial journal entry. As a result, the invoice is marked as Not paid.

  5. [Access the bank journal’s reconciliation view](../bank/reconciliation.html#accounting-reconciliation-access) and [reconcile](../bank/reconciliation.html#accounting-reconciliation-reconcile) the transaction created for the SDD rejection with the reversal of the entry related to the payment.
