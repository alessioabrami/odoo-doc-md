# Spagna¬∂

## Configurazione¬∂

Install the üá™üá∏ **Spanish** [fiscal localization package](../fiscal_localizations.html) to get all the default accounting features of the Spanish localization.

Three **Spanish** localizations exist, each with its own pre-configured **PGCE** charts of accounts:

  * Spain - SMEs (2008);

  * Spain - Complete (2008);

  * Spain - Non-profit entities (2008).




To select the one to use, go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings and select a package in the Fiscal Localization section.

Avvertimento

You can only change the accounting package as long as you have not created any accounting entry.

## Piano dei conti¬∂

You can reach the **Chart of Accounts** by going to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Accounting: Chart of Accounts.

Suggerimento

When you create a new Odoo Online database, **Spain - SMEs (2008)** is installed by default.

## Imposte¬∂

Default Spain-specific taxes are created automatically when the Spanish - Accounting (PGCE 2008) (l10n_es) module is installed, and tax reports are available when installing the module Spain - Accounting (PGCE 2008) (l10n_es_reports). Each tax impacts the Spain-specific **tax reports (Modelo)** , available by going to Accounting ‚Ä£ Reporting ‚Ä£ Statements Reports: Tax Report.

## Report¬∂

Here is the list of Spanish-specific statement reports available:

  * Balance Sheet;

  * Profit & Loss;

  * EC Sales List;

  * Tax Report (Modelo 111);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 115);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 130);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 303);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 347);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 349);

  * Tax Report (Modelo 390).




You can access Spain-specific tax reports by clicking on the **book** icon when on a report and selecting its Spain-specific version: (ES).

### Modelo 130¬∂

#### Change the percentage¬∂

If you wish to change the percentage computation of the box [04] under the I section and/or of the box [09] under the II section:

  1. Activate the [developer mode](../../general/developer_mode.html#developer-mode), go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Reporting ‚Ä£ Tax Report, and select the report Tax report (Modelo 130).

  2. Click the __( cogs) icon to the right of Report: Tax Report (Mod 130) (ES).

  3. Click the box you wish to change, and in the pop-up window, click on the percentage line. In the new pop-up window, change the value in the Formula field to the percentage you wish to apply. Repeat this action if you wish to modify the other box as well.




#### Report agriculture activity¬∂

If you wish to have any amount input in the II section (from boxes [08] to [11]), you must change the **industry** of the corresponding contact to Agriculture:

  1. Go to the contact form (Accounting ‚Ä£ Customers ‚Ä£ Customers or Accounting ‚Ä£ Vendors ‚Ä£ Vendors, for example), and select a contact.

  2. In the Sales & Purchase tab, set the Industry field to Agriculture.




Repeat this operation for all contacts related to the **agriculture** industry.

## TicketBAI¬∂

[Ticket BAI](https://www.gipuzkoa.eus/es/web/ogasuna/ticketbai) or **TBAI** is an e-Invoicing system used by the Basque government and its three provincial councils (√Ålava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa).

Odoo supports the **TicketBAI (TBAI)** electronic invoicing format for all three regions of the **Basque Country**. To enable **TicketBAI** , set your company‚Äôs Country and Tax ID under Settings ‚Ä£ General Settings in the Companies section.

Then, [install](../../general/apps_modules.html#general-install) the module Spain -TicketBAI (l10n_es_edi_TBAI), go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, and select a **region** in the Spain Localization section‚Äôs Tax Agency for TBAI field.

Once a region is selected, click Manage certificates (SII/TicketBAI), then click New, upload the certificate, and enter the password provided by the tax agency.

Avvertimento

If you are testing certificates, enable Test Mode in the Spain Localization section, which can be found under Accounting in the **Settings** app.

### Caso d‚Äôuso¬∂

Once an invoice has been [created](../accounting/customer_invoices.html) and confirmed, a TicketBAI **banner** appears at the top.

Odoo sends invoices through TicketBAI automatically every **24 hours**. However, you can click Process now to send the invoice immediately.

When the invoice is **sent** , the status of the field Electronic Invoice changes to Sent, and the XML file can be found in the **chatter**. Under the EDI Documents tab, you can see the traceability of other generated documents related to the invoice (e.g., if the invoice should also be sent through the **SII** , it will appear here).

Nota

The TBAI **QR code** is displayed on the invoice PDF.

## FACe¬∂

[FACe](https://face.gob.es/en) is the e-Invoicing platform used by the public administrations in Spain to send electronic invoices.

Before configuring the FACe system, [install](../../general/apps_modules.html#general-install) the Spain - Facturae EDI (l10n_es_edi_facturae) module and other **Facturae EDI** -related modules.

To enable FACe, go to Settings ‚Ä£ General Settings, click Update Info in the Companies section, then click Update Info and set the Country and Tax ID of your company. Next, add the Facturae signature certificate by clicking Add a line, uploading the certificate provided by the tax agency, and entering the provided password.

### Caso d‚Äôuso¬∂

Once you have [created](../accounting/customer_invoices.html) an invoice and confirmed it, click Send & Print. Make sure Generate Facturae edi file is enabled, and click Send & Print again. Once the invoice is sent, the generated XML file is available in the **chatter**.

Avvertimento

The file is **NOT** automatically sent. You have to send it yourself manually.

Suggerimento

You can send **FACe** XML files in batch through [the governmental portal](https://www.facturae.gob.es/formato/Paginas/descarga-aplicacion-escritorio.aspx).

### Administrative centers¬∂

In order for **FACe** to work with **administrative centers** , the invoice _must_ include specific data about the centers.

Nota

Make sure to have the Spain - Facturae EDI - Administrative Centers Patch (l10n_es_edi_facturae_adm_centers) module [installed](../../general/apps_modules.html#general-install).

To add **administrative centers** , create a new **contact** to add to the **partner** company. Select FACe Center as the **type** , assign one or more **role(s)** to that contact, and Save. The **three** roles usually required are:

  * √ìrgano gestor: Receptor (Receiver);

  * Unidad tramitadora: Pagador (Payer);

  * Oficina contable: Fiscal (Fiscal).




Suggerimento

  * If administrative centers need different Codes per role, you _must_ create different centers for each role.

  * When an electronic invoice is created using a partner with **administrative centers** , _all_ administrative centers are included in the invoice.

  * You can add one contact with multiple roles or multiple contacts with a different role each.
