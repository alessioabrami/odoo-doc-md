# Serial numbers and lots¶

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your products” movements. When products are tracked, the system identifies their location based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to Point of Sale ‣ Products ‣ Products. Then, select a product and check the Tracking By Unique Serial Number or the Tracking By Lots box in the Inventory tab.

## Serial numbers and lots importation¶

You can import serial numbers in Point of Sale. To do so, select a **sales order** or a **quotation** containing tracked products. Then, agree to load the **Lots or Serial Numbers** linked to the SO.

The imported tracking numbers appear below the tracked products. You can modify them by clicking on the list-view button next to the products.

## Serial numbers and lots creation¶

If a tracked product is available in your POS, adding the product to the cart opens a pop-up window where you can type or scan the product’s serial or lot numbers. To add more than one of the same tracked products, click on **enter** to validate and start a new line.

Nota

  * Changing a tracked product’s quantity using the numpad turns the list-view button red. Click on it to add the missing lot and serial numbers.

  * Lot & Serial Number(s) are required on tracked products but not mandatory. Meaning that not attributing some or any does **not** prevent from completing the sale.
