# SMS Marketing¶

Utilizing SMS outreach in communication strategies can help companies expand their market reach, especially in some countries, where emails might not be very common, or even used at all.

Odoo’s _SMS Marketing_ application can also help boost conversion rates around valuable actions, such as event registrations, free trials, purchases, etc., since text and mobile-based marketing channels typically yield higher CTOR and CTR outcomes.

## SMS marketing dashboard¶

When the application is opened, Odoo displays the main SMS Marketing dashboard, which showcases the various SMS mailings that have been created, along with pertinent information and data related to that specific message.

The __ Kanban view is the default Odoo uses when the application is opened, which provides an organized display of the SMS mailings that have been created, and what their current status is at the moment.

Nota

An SMS mailing can have one of the following statuses: Draft, In Queue, Sending, or Sent.

In the upper right corner of the main SMS Marketing dashboard, there are a few different view options to choose from. Each one provides a unique take on the same SMS information.

The __ List view provides the same useful data related to SMS mailings, but in a more traditional list layout.

The __ Calendar view shows when SMS mailings are scheduled or have been sent. Clicking a future date opens a blank SMS template to be scheduled for that date.

Lastly, the __ Graph view visualizes that same SMS-related data in series of graphs and charts. Odoo also provides various ways to sort and group the data for more detailed analysis.
