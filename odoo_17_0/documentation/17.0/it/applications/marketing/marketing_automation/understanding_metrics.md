# Campaign metrics¬∂

_Campaign metrics_ are detailed statistics and analytics within a marketing campaign, measuring its success and effectiveness. Triggered marketing activities populate relevant activity blocks with real-time metrics, in the campaign detail form.

## Activity analytics¬∂

In the Workflow section of a campaign detail form in the _Marketing Automation_ app, where the various campaign activities are located, a collection of useful data can be found on every individual activity block, like number of communications Sent, percentage of messages that have been Clicked, and more.

To the left of the activity block, the configured [trigger time](workflow_activities.html) is displayed as a duration (either Hours, Days, Weeks, or Months) if it corresponds to period after the workflow begins.

Nota

If the trigger time is dependent on another activity or triggering action (e.g. Mail: Replied, etc.) the time is displayed, along with the necessary action for that activity to be activated (e.g. `Replied after 2 Hours`).

In the activity block, an icon represents each activity type. An ‚úâÔ∏è (envelope) icon means the activity is an email. Three tiny, interlocking ‚öôÔ∏è (gear) icons means the activity is an internal action. And, a small, basic üì± (mobile) icon means the activity is an SMS.

Suggerimento

The activity type name is also displayed in smaller font below the activity title.

Beside the activity icon, at the top of the activity block, is the title of the activity. To the right of the activity title, there are Edit and Delete buttons.

Click Edit to open the Open: Activities pop-up form for that specific activity, in which that activity can be modified. Click the Delete button to completely delete that specific activity from the workflow.

### Activity graph tab¬∂

In every activity block, the Graph (pie chart icon) tab is open by default, displaying related metrics as a simple line graph. The success metrics are represented in `green` and the rejected metrics are represented in `red`.

Numerical representations of both Success and Rejected activities are shown to the right of the line graph.

Suggerimento

Hovering over any point in the line graph of the activity block reveals a notated breakdown of data for that specific date.

Beneath the graph in the activity block, for _Email_ or _SMS_ activity types, a line of accessible data figures provide a bird‚Äôs eye view of the campaign activity, including: Sent (numerical), Clicked (percentage), Replied (percentage), and Bounced (percentage).

Suggerimento

Clicking any of those stats on the DETAILS line, beneath the line graph, reveals a separate page containing every specific record for that particular data point.

### Activity filter tab¬∂

Next to the Graph tab on the activity block, there‚Äôs the option to open a Filter tab (represented by a filter/funnel icon).

Clicking the Filter tab on an activity block, reveals what the specific filters are for that particular campaign activity, and how many records in the database match that specific criteria.

Suggerimento

Clicking the records link beneath the displayed filter reveals a separate pop-up window containing a list of all the records that match that specific campaign activity rule(s).

## Link tracker¬∂
